## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    > _Make sure **Hardhat** and **ethers** are installed for contract deployment._

2. **Compile the contract**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

3. **Deploy the contract**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploySafeWallet.ts --network YOUR_NETWORK
    ```
    > _The contract deploys with owner `0xFDf84a0e7D07bC56f7De56696fc409704cC83a24` as the signer. Replace `YOUR_NETWORK` with `mainnet`, `polygon`, etc._

4. **Frontend Usage**
    - The frontend will automatically use `0xFDf84a0e7D07bC56f7De56696fc409704cC83a24` for all contract interactions.
    - Example:
        ```typescript
        import { getSafeSigner } from "./utils/signer";
